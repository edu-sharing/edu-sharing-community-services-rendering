# Maven Git Workflow

Maven artifacts, Docker images, Helm charts, etc., are versioned based on the Git branch name or tag.  
From `maven/fixes/10.0`, the artifact is built with the version `<artifactid>:maven-fixes-10.0-SNAPSHOT`.

## Feature Branch Workflow

Feature branches are treated specially.  
Feature branches following the pattern `maven/feature/<version>-My-Fancy-Feature` also produce Maven artifacts with the version  
`<artifactid>:maven-fixes-<version>-SNAPSHOT`.  
For example, from `maven/feature/10.0-My-Fancy-Feature`, the artifact will be built with the version  
`<artifactid>:maven-fixes-10.0-SNAPSHOT`.

This allows feature branches to be created without requiring all projects to use the same branch name.

To avoid cross-project artifact conflicts between different feature branches, the environment variable `PROJECT_NAME` can be used  
to prefix the artifact for each customer project.  
In this case, the artifact will be generated as `<artifactid>:<PROJECT_NAME>maven-fixes-<version>-SNAPSHOT`.

**Example:**  
`PROJECT_NAME=community-`  
From `maven/feature/10.0-My-Fancy-Feature`, the artifact will be built with the version  
`<artifactid>:community-maven-fixes-10.0-SNAPSHOT`.

It is important that all projects are built using the same `PROJECT_NAME`.

This is handled by edu-dev-tools ij command for you

Additionally, the Maven property `project.version.base` is overridden to always point to the underlying  
`maven-fixes-<version>-SNAPSHOT` version.  
This can be handy for external managed projects like `rendering-service-2`.
